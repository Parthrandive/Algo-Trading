# Week 3 — Partner Plan: Macro Monitor Agent
**Dates:** Mon, February 23 – Sun, March 1, 2026
**Owner:** Partner
**Aligned to:** Phase 1 Data Orchestration Execution Plan v2.0 — Section 5.2, 5.5
**Master Plan Reference:** Multi_Agent_AI_Trading_System_Plan_Updated v1.3.7 — Section 5.2

---

## Goal
Build the Macro Monitor Agent to ingest India macro and cross-asset indicators with scheduled jobs, freshness SLAs, and alerting. Publish canonical sample payloads for downstream Preprocessing Agent consumption.

## Phase 1 GO/NO-GO Contribution (Section 16.1)
This workstream contributes to:
- **Macro job schedule adherence ≥ 95%**
- **Provenance tagging coverage = 100%**
- **Data uptime ≥ 99.5%** (for macro feeds during scheduled windows)

## Frozen Indicator Catalog (Schema v1.1)

| Indicator | Source | Period | Freshness Window | Unit |
|-----------|--------|--------|------------------|------|
| CPI | MOSPI / RBI | Monthly | 48h after release | % |
| WPI | Office of Economic Adviser | Monthly | 48h after release | % |
| IIP | MOSPI | Monthly | 48h after release | % |
| FII Flow | NSDL / NSE | Daily | 4h (by EOD+4h) | INR_Cr |
| DII Flow | NSDL / NSE | Daily | 4h (by EOD+4h) | INR_Cr |
| FX Reserves | RBI Weekly Statistical Supplement | Weekly | 24h after Friday release | USD_Bn |
| RBI Bulletins | RBI website | Irregular | 24h after publication | count |
| India-US 10Y Spread | RBI + FRED/Treasury.gov | Daily | 6h | bps |

### RBI Bulletin Encoding Rule (Schema Compatibility)
- `MacroIndicator.value` is numeric in `src/schemas/macro_data.py`.
- For `RBI_BULLETIN`, encode publication as an event marker: `value=1.0`, `unit="count"`, `period="Irregular"`.
- Raw bulletin text extraction remains in the Textual Data Agent scope.

### Global Proxy Justification (Section 5.2 Requirement)
> Global proxies such as Brent and DXY must be **explicitly justified as India-relevant or removed**.

| Proxy | Included? | Justification |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Brent Crude (`BRENT_CRUDE`) | Yes — already in enum | Direct impact on India's import bill, INR pressure, and inflation expectations |
| DXY | Not in current catalog | Defer — India-US 10Y spread + INR/USD capture the relevant FX signal |

---

## Shared Schema Contract

All macro data **must** conform to the `MacroIndicator` Pydantic model in `src/schemas/macro_data.py`:
```python
# Required fields for every record:
indicator_name: MacroIndicatorType  # enum value from catalog above
value: float
unit: str          # e.g., "%", "INR_Cr", "bps", "USD_Bn", "count"
period: str        # "Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly"
timestamp: datetime  # observation date (timezone-aware)
source_type: SourceType  # "official_api" | "broker_api" | "fallback_scraper"
schema_version: str  # Must be "1.1"
quality_status: QualityFlag  # "pass" | "warn" | "fail"
# Auto-populated:
ingestion_timestamp_utc, ingestion_timestamp_ist, region
```

> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** The `MacroIndicatorType` enum must include these exact values:
> `CPI, WPI, IIP, GDP, INR_USD, BRENT_CRUDE, US_10Y, INDIA_10Y, FII_FLOW, DII_FLOW, REPO_RATE, FX_RESERVES, INDIA_US_10Y_SPREAD, RBI_BULLETIN`

### Indicator Scope (Week 3 vs Accepted Enum)
- **Accepted enum set:** 14 values above must be accepted by schema/contracts.
- **Week 3 required publish set (CP3):** `CPI, WPI, IIP, FII_FLOW, DII_FLOW, FX_RESERVES, RBI_BULLETIN, INDIA_US_10Y_SPREAD`.

### Data Usage Policy (Section 3 Requirement)
Only publicly released or contractually licensed feeds are permitted. Unpublished or embargoed information is **prohibited**.

## Daily Backlog

### Day 1 (Mon, Feb 23) — Contract Freeze 🔒 CP1
- [x] Confirm indicator catalog matches table above
- [x] Add `FX_RESERVES`, `INDIA_US_10Y_SPREAD`, `RBI_BULLETIN` to `MacroIndicatorType` enum
- [x] Bump `schema_version` default to `"1.1"`
- [x] Document global proxy justification (Brent included, DXY excluded with rationale)
- [x] Create `configs/macro_monitor_runtime_v1.json` with per-indicator source config (URL patterns, retry, rate limits, freshness windows)
- [x] **Deliverable:** Frozen schema + runtime config + proxy justification committed

### Day 2 (Tue, Feb 24) — Source Connector Skeletons
- [x] Create `src/agents/macro/` package
- [x] Define `MacroClientInterface` (Protocol) with `get_indicator(name, date_range)` method
- [x] Scaffold concrete client stubs: `MOSPIClient`, `RBIClient`, `NSEDIIFIIClient`, `FXReservesClient`, `BondSpreadClient`
- [x] Write `MacroSilverRecorder` (Parquet + DB persistence, following sentinel recorder patterns)
- [x] Ensure provenance tagging on every record (source_type, ingestion timestamps, schema_version, quality_status)
- [x] **Deliverable:** All skeletons committed, 28/28 tests pass ✅

### Day 3 (Wed, Feb 25) — Parsers: CPI / WPI / IIP / RBI Bulletins
- [x] Implement `CPIParser` — normalize MOSPI payload → `MacroIndicator`
- [x] Implement `WPIParser` — normalize OEA payload → `MacroIndicator`
- [x] Implement `IIPParser` — normalize MOSPI payload → `MacroIndicator`
- [x] Implement `RBIBulletinParser` — extract structured fields from bulletin HTML/PDF
- [x] Add data quality checks: missingness, outliers, and latency (Section 5.2 requirement)
- [x] Unit tests for all 4 parsers (`tests/agents/macro/test_parsers.py`)
- [x] **Deliverable:** All 4 parsers produce valid `MacroIndicator` records with quality checks

### Day 4 (Thu, Feb 26) — Parsers: FII/DII, FX Reserves, 10Y Spread
